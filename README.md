# House_price_prediction
In this project I have performed house price prediction by Using the kaggle dataset.
First we check the dimension of the dataset.
Then we visualize the data for better understanding.
We drop the unnessary dta columns as it will not be important for our prediction.
Necessary encoding techniques are implemented i.e. One hot encoding in this case
We put the final dataset in training phase and then we apply Linear regression algorithm.
We predict the Output.
